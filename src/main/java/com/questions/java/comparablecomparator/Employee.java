/*
Java provides Comparable interface which should be implemented by any custom class if we want to use
Arrays or Collections sorting methods. Comparable interface has compareTo(T obj) method which is used
by sorting methods, you can check any Wrapper, String or Date class to confirm this. We should override
this method in such a way that it returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if “this” object
is less than, equal to, or greater than the object passed as argument.

Comparator interface compare(Object o1, Object o2) method need to be implemented that takes two Object argument,
it should be implemented in such a way that it returns negative int if first argument is less than the second
one and returns zero if they are equal and positive int if first argument is greater than second one.

Comparable and Comparator interfaces uses Generics for compile time type checking
